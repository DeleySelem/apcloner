# APCloner v4.2 - Passive WiFi Handshake Capture Tool

![APCloner Banner](assets/banner.png)

A non-intrusive wireless security assessment tool that passively captures WPA handshakes by creating cloned access point replicas. **Does not perform deauthentication attacks.**

## üìñ Description

APCloner creates multiple cloned replicas of a target access point, acting as WiFi honeypots to passively capture WPA handshakes when devices:
- Connect to the network for the first time
- Naturally reconnect due to signal fluctuations
- Perform periodic network checks

**Ethical Advantage:** Complies with wireless testing ethics by avoiding active client deauthentication.

## ‚ú® Features

- üõ°Ô∏è Passive handshake capture methodology
- üì∂ Creates 5 monitor interfaces for cloning
- üéØ Automatic handshake detection & alerting
- üñ•Ô∏è Interactive menu and CLI modes
- üìä Wireless network scanner integration
- üé® Colorized terminal interface
- üîÑ Automatic cleanup routines
